# Lost World RPG

## Overview
Lost World RPG is a work-in-progress game built in Unreal Engine 5. It features core gameplay systems focused on locomotion, combat, and player progression, with dynamic AI behaviors for enemies and animals.
This game is still a bit incomplete however you can see the git commit messages to see currently what is being add to the game. 

## Features

- **Locomotion System**: Implemented complex character movements such as vaulting, crouching, climbing, and swimming.
- **Combat System**: Designed a robust melee system with sword combos, target locking, assassination, and blocking mechanics.
- **Player Progression**: Developed systems for leveling, experience points (XP), equipment management, and quests to enhance player growth.
- **AI Behaviors**: Integrated enemy and animal AI with behavioral trees, creating realistic interactions and combat scenarios. 
- **Damage System**: Designed a dynamic damage system affecting players, enemies, and animals, linked to AI and combat mechanics.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sjpjoshi/LostWorld.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Unreal Engine 5 and build from the editor.

## Bugs to be addressed
- [ ] Animals sometimes don't load in
- [ ] Enemy loses focus of player easily
- [ ] Strange climbing bug: When you read the top it will clip through the wall

# Note
The gif files are incredibly large but I also used a online converter, it looks slow however it does run fast. 
Once the game is complete there will be a executable file for Windows, Mac, and Linux in a folder so you don't have to clone the repo. 

## Roadmap
- [ ] Open World Map
- [ ] Map marker system
- [ ] Complete player progression system with more equipment and quests.
- [ ] Refine AI behavior to include more complex combat strategies.
- [ ] Implement add magic abilities.
- [ ] Save and load features
- [ ] Market Towns
